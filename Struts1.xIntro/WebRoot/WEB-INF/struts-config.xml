<!--
     This is a blank Struts configuration file with an example
     welcome action/page and other commented sample elements.

     Struts Validator is configured using the factory defaults
     and is ready-to-use.

     NOTE: If you have a generator tool to create the corresponding Java classes
     for you, you could include the details in the "form-bean" declarations.
     Otherwise, you would only define the "form-bean" element itself, with the
     corresponding "name" and "type" attributes, as shown here.
